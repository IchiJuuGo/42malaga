# PYTHON OPERATORS

#############

# ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
 # Operador, ejemplo, igual que
+	Addition	x + y	
-	Subtraction	x - y
*	Multiplication	x * y
/	Division	x / y
%	Modulus	x % y
**	Exponentiation	x ** y
//	Floor division	x // y

# ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
 # Operador, ejemplo, igual que
=	x = 5	x = 5
+=	x += 3	x = x + 3
-=	x -= 3	x = x - 3
*=	x *= 3	x = x * 3
/=	x /= 3	x = x / 3
%=	x %= 3	x = x % 3
//=	x //= 3	x = x // 3
**=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3
&=	x &= 3	x = x & 3
|=	x |= 3	x = x | 3
^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
>>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
<<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3

# COMPARISON OPERATORS
==	Equal	x == y
!=	Not equal	x != y
>	Greater than	x > y
<	Less than	x < y
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y
<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y

# LOGICAL OPERATORS
and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10
or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4
not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)

# IDENTITY OPERATORS
is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object	x is y
is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y

# MEMBERSHIP OPERATORS
in 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	x in y
not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	x not in y

# BITWISE OPERATORS
& 	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1	x & y
|	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1	x | y	Try it »
^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1	x ^ y
~	NOT	Inverts all the bits	~x

# OPERATOR PRECEDENCE
()	Parentheses
**	Exponentiation
+x  -x  ~x	Unary plus, unary minus, and bitwise NOT
*  /  //  %	Multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus
+  -	Addition and subtraction
<<  >>	Bitwise left and right shifts
&	Bitwise AND
^	Bitwise XOR
|	Bitwise OR
==  !=  >  >=  <  <=  is  is not  in  not in 	Comparisons, identity, and membership operators
not	Logical NOT
and	AND	Try it »
or	

# If two operators have the same precedence, the expression is evaluated from left to right.
